# Talented for Onyxia (Kader Edition)

This is a fork of Talented from bKader(https://github.com/bkader/Talented_WoTLK) updated for use Warmane's Onyxia PTE server with Vanilla (and later TBC) Talents.

## Install Note:
Make sure you delete all Talented data from your WTF folder.  This may contain data from later expansions which will cause errors in this version.

Below is the text from Kader until something different is done for support of Onyxia's Vanilla/TBC Talents.

---
This is the same old **Talented** addon but instead of having its modules as separate addons, they are included (_Talented\_GlyphFrame & Talented\_SpecTabs_).

Also, all those separated core files were put into single files depending on the context.

Other than that, nothing was modified except for the glyphs frame that was buggy, now it's working fine and also the code was optimized and cleaned.

## Extra:

Instead of those non-working official sites (_wowhead, wowdb, mmo-champion .. etc_), you can now export/import your templates to/from:

1. EvoWoW.com
2. WoTLKDB.com
3. Altervisa.org
4. TrueWoW.org

## Install:

1. [Download the package.](https://github.com/bkader/Talented_WoTLK/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Open the archive, then open folder Talented_WoTLK-main, extract the single folder to `Interface\AddOns`.
3. Enjoy!
